<h1><p>This is Lio and Elias's rules for the room and also some things about us</p>
<p>Lionel:My name is lionel(its pretty obvious)and I love coding and thats how i'm doing this by coding and so after I started coding I felt like giving up because I thought it was pretty boring even though thats what I want to do and I did quit but i'm starting to get back into it and as the years and months pass by I will try to get better at it and I think I have a bright future ahead of me but I will have to wait until my hard works pays off and that future will be there but for right now I Just need to wait.</p>
